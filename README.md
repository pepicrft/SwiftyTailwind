**SwiftyTailwind** is a Swift Package to lazily download and run the [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) CLI from a Swift project (e.g. [Vapor](https://vapor.codes) app or [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish) project). 

## Usage

First, you need to add `SwiftyTailwind` as a dependency in your project's `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/pepicrft/SwiftyTailwind.git", .upToNextMinor(from: "0.1.0"))
```

Once added, you'll create an instance of `SwiftyTailwind` specifying the version you'd like to use and where you'd like it to be downloaded.

```swift
let tailwind = SwiftyTailwind(version: .latest, directory: "./cache")
```

If you don't pass any argument, it defaults to the latest version in the system's default temporary directory. If you work in a team, we recommend fixing the version to minimize non-determinism across environments.

### Initializing a `tailwind.config.js`

You can create a `tailwind.config.js` configuration file by running the [`initialize`](https://swiftytailwind.pepicrft.me/documentation/swiftytailwind/swiftytailwind/initialize(directory:options:)) function on the `SwiftyTailwind` instance:


```swift
try await tailwind.initialize()
```

Check out all the available options in [the documentation](https://swiftytailwind.pepicrft.me/documentation/swiftytailwind/swiftytailwind/initializeoption).

### Running Tailwind

To run Tailwind against a project, you can use the [`run`](https://swiftytailwind.pepicrft.me/documentation/swiftytailwind/swiftytailwind/run(input:output:directory:options:)) function:

```swift
try await subject.run(input: inputCSSPath, output: outputCSSPath, .content("views/**/*.html"))
```

If you'd like Tailwind to keep watching for file changes, you can pass the `.watch` option:


```swift
try await subject.run(input: inputCSSPath, 
                      output: outputCSSPath, 
                      options: .watch, .content("views/**/*.html"))
```

Check out all the available options in the [documentation](https://swiftytailwind.pepicrft.me/documentation/swiftytailwind/swiftytailwind/runoption).
